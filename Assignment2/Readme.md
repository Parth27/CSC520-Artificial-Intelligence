In this assignment, we implemented multiple search algorithms to solve the globe puzzle.
The globe puzzle is similar to rubick's cube and more details about it can be found in the assignment description.

Implemented Breadth First Search (BFS), A-Star and Recursive Best First Search (RBFS) algorithms.
Designed a novel heuristic which was able to solve this problem quickly.

Implemented in Python3.
